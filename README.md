This project investigates vehicle advertisement data in the United States from May 2018 until April 2019.  Exploratory data analysis was done to see how sale price related to days listed, odometer reading, type of vehicle, and condition of the vehicle.  Scatterplots, histograms, and barplots were created when appropriate.  These results were published to https://eric4.onrender.com/ where the user can select which parameters to investigate.

Based on the EDA the following observations were made:
1. vehicles listed as "new" sold on average 2 days sooner.
2. there is an inverse relationship between sale price and miles on odometer.
3. there is an inverse relationship between sale price and days the ad was listed.
