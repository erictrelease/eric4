This project investigates vehicle advertisement data in the United States from May 2018 until April 2019.  Exploratory data analysis was done to see how sale price related to days listed, odometer reading, type of vehicle, and condition of the vehicle.  Scatterplots, histograms, and barplots were created when appropriate.  

Based on the EDA the following observations were made:
1. vehicles listed as "new" sold on average 2 days sooner.
2. there is an inverse relationship between sale price and miles on odometer.
3. there is an inverse relationship between sale price and days the ad was listed.

All the files used in this project are accessible in a repository and can be cloned to a local computer by git clone https://github.com/erictrelease/eric4

These results were also published to https://eric4.onrender.com/ where the user can easily select which parameters to investigate.
